# journal — live-write-guardrail

done:   PRD written. `omi`'s only write guard is the paper/live port gate; it says nothing about whether
        the live order is sane (magnitude/side/price), and the order is composed by CC from natural
        language with no deterministic breaker (2026-07-06 incident = a wrong instruction reached a real
        order). Fractional is API-dead ([10243], verified on paper today) ⇒ min live fill = 1 whole share
        ⇒ a notional cap is the only economic breaker. Goal: on LIVE opening orders, refuse (offline,
        before connect, in trade.rs) anything not-LMT / over-cap / combo; paper untouched. Decisions
        locked with operator (3 questions): D1 live must be LMT (MKT refused; STK-only bite); D2 notional
        = qty×|limit|×mult (STK×1/OPT×100), >cap ⇒ refuse (reuse shape_preview math); D3 cap default $500,
        OMI_MAX_NOTIONAL overrides (bad value ⇒ fail-closed); D4 live combo refused (interlock: combo
        paper-only); D5 cap on OPENING orders only (buy/sell/option-buy/option-sell via place_core) —
        option-close EXEMPT (never block an exit; bypasses place_core), cancel N/A, preview exempt.
        Freezable (refuse paths are offline-deterministic) — NEW spec file, no re-freeze. Live-trial
        BLOCKER. Trade log = the NEXT feature (operator decided), not this card.

Run pipeline-arch on a FRESH session (assume you know nothing — rebuild from the repo + CONTRACT.md).
repo=git@github.com:jackypanster/oh-my-ib.git branch=main pr=none
Model: frontier SOTA required — operator assigns the bot; the pipeline can't verify the model.
First: git pull --rebase; load repo config (.env if present, per CONTRACT step 2).
Read for context (before acting):
  - oh-my-ib/AGENTS.md + CLAUDE.md — repo conventions (agent-first; hard safety rules; Verify = 4 gates)
  - .pipeline/live-write-guardrail/PRD.md — problem + the 5 locked decisions (D1-D5) + rejected alts
  - src/ib/trade.rs — the write module. KEY seams: require_live_write_gate (175, the port gate — extend
    ALONGSIDE, never weaken); shape_preview (79, has the notional math qty×|limit|×mult to extract);
    place_core (468, shared by buy/sell/option-buy/option-sell — the wire point for the posture check);
    place_with_client (349, the choke point — option-close routes here directly, so it is EXEMPT by
    construction; do NOT add the check here); option_combo (713, add a live-refuse line at its gate site
    766); build_stk_order (31, limit None ⇒ order_type MKT — the D1 signal).
  - src/config.rs — LIVE_PORT (14), Config (port/preview), merge_flags; decide if OMI_MAX_NOTIONAL is
    read in config.rs or in trade.rs (the gate reads env directly in trade.rs — precedent).
  - src/error.rs — AppError kinds (config=exit5 is the refuse code; usage=64 an option for the MKT case).
Your task (concrete, numbered):
  1. Confirm the mechanism + emit ADR 0030 (next number). Pin: (a) compute_notional pure seam extracted
     from shape_preview (STK×1 / OPT×100; MKT ⇒ None ⇒ no cap number but D1 refuses live MKT first);
     (b) a pure live-posture decision fn — inputs (is_effective_live, is_mkt, notional: Option<f64>,
     cap) → Ok / Err(reason); (c) the OMI_MAX_NOTIONAL reader (absent⇒$500 default const; present⇒parse,
     ≤0 or non-numeric ⇒ config error — fail-closed); (d) the wire: posture check inside place_core
     AFTER the preview branch and paired with require_live_write_gate (both offline, before connect) +
     a live-refuse in option_combo; option-close/cancel/paper/preview untouched.
  2. Decide the exact error kind per refuse (recommend: config for over-cap + combo + bad-env; usage OR
     config for live-MKT — pick one and freeze it). Decide error message shape (must name notional, cap,
     and the OMI_MAX_NOTIONAL escape for the cap case).
  3. Decide cap default location: a `const DEFAULT_MAX_NOTIONAL: f64 = 500.0` (where?) + whether a
     config.toml key is added now (PRD says env primary, config optional — recommend env-only this card).
  4. Write arch.md (chosen shape + component boundaries: which fns are pure/frozen vs gateway-wired) +
     CONTEXT.md (glossary: the port gate vs the write POSTURE guard; opening vs closing order; notional;
     effective-live) + docs/adr/0030-*.md. Do NOT write src or tests.
Feature gotchas (project-specific traps the next node MUST know):
  - Guard fires ONLY when cfg.port == LIVE_PORT AND !cfg.preview. Paper + preview EXEMPT by construction.
  - option-close is EXEMPT (never block an exit) — it bypasses place_core; do NOT put the check in
    place_with_client or you will catch closes. cancel = N/A (no notional).
  - D1 (live must be LMT) only bites STK — options/combo are already LMT-only. The cap (D2) applies to all
    opening verbs.
  - Fail-closed on a bad OMI_MAX_NOTIONAL — a typo must REFUSE, never fall back to $500.
  - The within-cap→place path is NOT freezable (would place a real live order) — that is operator live
    acceptance (the first trial order). Freeze the REFUSE decisions + notional math + env parse only.
  - Do NOT weaken require_live_write_gate; extend alongside it.

done:   Arch + ADR 0030 accepted (all D1-D5 confirmed with operator incl D5 exempt=close). Shape: 4 PURE
        seams in trade.rs + thin wiring. Frozen seams: compute_notional(qty,limit:Option,mult)->Option
        (mirror shape_preview); resolve_max_notional(Option<&str>)->Result (None⇒500.0 DEFAULT; parse,
        finite∧>0 else Err — fail-closed); check_live_write_posture(is_live,is_mkt,notional,cap)->Result

        refuse_live_combo_on_live(is_live)->Result. const DEFAULT_MAX_NOTIONAL=500.0. All refuses=
        AppError::config (exit5). Wiring (review-by-reading): place_core (468) posture check AFTER gate,
        BEFORE connect (multiplier from contract.security_type; is_mkt from order.order_type; env read
        inline like the gate); option_combo (766) refuse_live_combo before the gate on the real path.
        UNTOUCHED: require_live_write_gate body, place_with_client (⇒ option-close exempt structurally),
        option_close, cancel, shape_preview JSON (order-preview tests must stay green), config.rs (env
        primary, no toml key this card). Freezable (refuses offline-deterministic) — NEW spec file, no
        re-freeze. Live-pass path = operator live acceptance (first trial order).

Model: frontier SOTA required — operator assigns the bot; the pipeline can't verify the model.
First: git pull --rebase.
Read: .pipeline/live-write-guardrail/{PRD.md,arch.md,CONTEXT.md,docs/adr/0030-*}; src/ib/trade.rs
      (shape_preview 79/85 the notional math; place_core 468; place_with_client 349; option_combo 713/766;
      build_stk_order 31/44 MKT signal); src/ib/mod.rs:45 (re-export line); src/config.rs LIVE_PORT 14;
      tests/order_preview_command.rs (shape_preview JSON must stay green); an existing pure-seam test file
      for style (e.g. tests/option_chain_filter.rs).
Your task (concrete, numbered):
  1. Write ONE red spec file tests/live_write_guardrail.rs importing
     oh_my_ib::ib::{compute_notional, resolve_max_notional, check_live_write_posture,
     refuse_live_combo_on_live}. It MUST compile-fail NOW (unresolved imports — the seams don't exist yet)
     — that is the genuine RED. Assertions (~appropriate, not 100%):
       - compute_notional: LMT value uses |limit| (e.g. 2×|3.0|×100=600; STK mult 1); MKT (None)⇒None.
       - resolve_max_notional: None⇒500.0; Some("1000")⇒1000.0; Some("abc")/Some("0")/Some("-5")/
         Some("")⇒Err (fail-closed). (Some("inf") — decide + assert per ADR: finite required ⇒ Err.)
       - check_live_write_posture: paper (is_live=false) ⇒ Ok even for is_mkt=true / huge notional; live
         MKT (is_mkt=true) ⇒ Err; live over-cap (Some(600),cap 500) ⇒ Err; live within-cap (Some(300),cap
         500) ⇒ Ok; boundary Some(500)==cap ⇒ Ok (> is the refuse, not >=).
       - refuse_live_combo_on_live: true⇒Err, false⇒Ok.
     Card 01 is a SINGLE card (one observable behaviour: "the live write posture guardrail").
  2. Freeze in TWO commits (CONTRACT §spec-rev double-commit): (a) freeze commit = ONLY
     tests/live_write_guardrail.rs → its sha = spec-rev; (b) record commit = tasks/01.md frontmatter
     (status: todo, attempts: 0, verify: [cargo build, cargo test --test live_write_guardrail],
     spec-paths: [tests/live_write_guardrail.rs], impl-paths: [src/ib/trade.rs, src/ib/mod.rs, src/cli.rs],
     spec-rev: <sha from a>) + current.json stage=task (full-verify [cargo build, cargo test]) + journal
     seq=3. NEVER mix the test and the card in one commit.
  3. In the card's `## Freeze coverage`: FROZEN = the 4 pure seams (above); REVIEW-BY-READING = the
     place_core/option_combo wiring (per ADR 0030 §Seams); OPERATOR LIVE ACCEPTANCE = the refuse commands
     exit 5 / the within-cap first trial order.
Feature gotchas:
  - spec-paths ∩ impl-paths = ∅ (test file vs src). The seams are NEW pub fns in trade.rs re-exported at
    mod.rs:45 — the coder adds them; the red is the unresolved import.
  - shape_preview JSON output must stay byte-identical (order-preview frozen tests) whether or not the
    coder routes it through compute_notional. Flag this in the card.
  - option-close / cancel / preview / paper MUST stay unchanged — the check lives in place_core (NOT
    place_with_client) precisely so closes stay exempt.
  - Do NOT freeze the within-cap→place path (would place a real live order) — that is operator acceptance.
  - Safe to develop with the Tiger gateway UP: every guardrail refuse is offline (no connect); the frozen
    tests are pure (no gateway).
Done when: tests/live_write_guardrail.rs frozen (compiles+FAILS on unresolved imports); card 01 recorded;

repo=git@github.com:jackypanster/oh-my-ib.git branch=main pr=none
Model: capable-local OK (impl only).
First: git pull --rebase.
Read: .pipeline/live-write-guardrail/tasks/01.md (THE CARD — verbatim seam signatures + wiring); arch.md
      §Write-set; docs/adr/0030-*; CONTEXT.md. In src: src/ib/trade.rs (shape_preview 79/85 the notional

Your task (concrete, numbered):
  1. git checkout -b feat/live-write-guardrail (cut from trunk — inherits the live-gate guard 5b5b59b).
  2. Add the 4 pure seams + `pub const DEFAULT_MAX_NOTIONAL: f64 = 500.0;` to src/ib/trade.rs (exact
     signatures/bodies in the card). Re-export the 4 fns at src/ib/mod.rs:45.
  3. Wire: place_core (468) posture check AFTER require_live_write_gate, BEFORE connect (is_live from
     cfg.port==LIVE_PORT; cap from env OMI_MAX_NOTIONAL via resolve_max_notional; multiplier from
     contract.security_type; is_mkt from order.order_type=="MKT"; notional from compute_notional). Map
     every Err → AppError::config(msg, ctx). option_combo (766) refuse_live_combo_on_live before the gate
     on the !cfg.preview path. Update src/cli.rs Buy/Sell docs.
  4. Green gates: cargo build / cargo test --test live_write_guardrail (card-scoped — must go GREEN) /
     cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings. Also confirm tests/order_preview_command.rs stays green
     (shape_preview JSON unchanged) — run cargo test locally (SAFE: guardrail refuses are offline, the
     frozen tests are pure, no live-placing test in this feature).
  5. Open PR feat→main; set current.json.pr; journal seq=4 (impl→review); print pipeline-review handoff.
Feature gotchas:
  - Do NOT edit tests/live_write_guardrail.rs (frozen, spec-rev 817c7d8). Make it green by adding the
    seams, not by changing the test.
  - Do NOT touch place_with_client / option_close / cancel — the check lives in place_core precisely so
    option-close stays EXEMPT (never block an exit). Do NOT touch require_live_write_gate's body.
  - shape_preview JSON MUST stay byte-identical (order-preview frozen tests). If you route it through
    compute_notional, verify the emitted numbers are unchanged.
  - Fail-closed: a bad OMI_MAX_NOTIONAL must REFUSE (config error), never default to 500.
  - Shared worktree: you own it during impl; cc/codex won't run git here until your PR is up.

Run pipeline-review on a FRESH session — ASSIGN TO CODEX (semantic review); CC runs the full-suite gate
+ operator live acceptance + merges.
repo=git@github.com:jackypanster/oh-my-ib.git branch=main pr=27
base=main head=feat/live-write-guardrail
Model: frontier SOTA required for semantic review (operator assigns the bot; the pipeline can't verify).
First: git pull --rebase; gh pr checkout 27 (or read the diff on GitHub).
Read for context (before reviewing):
  - .pipeline/live-write-guardrail/tasks/01.md (THE CARD — verbatim seam signatures + wiring +
    Freeze coverage: FROZEN=4 pure seams; REVIEW-BY-READING=place_core/option_combo wiring;
    OPERATOR LIVE ACCEPTANCE=the refuse commands + the within-cap first trial order)
  - .pipeline/live-write-guardrail/{PRD.md,arch.md,CONTEXT.md,docs/adr/0030-live-write-guardrail.md}
  - The diff (3 files, +95/-3): src/ib/trade.rs (seams at ~185-252, place_core wiring ~549-565,
    option_combo wiring ~853-856), src/ib/mod.rs:45 (re-export), src/cli.rs:83-88 (Buy/Sell docs)
Your task (concrete, numbered):
  1. SEMANTIC REVIEW (the spec freeze is already GREEN — do NOT edit tests/live_write_guardrail.rs):
     verify the 4 pure seams match the card's verbatim bodies EXACTLY (compute_notional mirror of
     shape_preview; resolve_max_notional fail-closed incl. non-finite; check_live_write_posture — !live
     ⇒ Ok, is_mkt ⇒ Err, notional > cap ⇒ Err, boundary == cap ⇒ Ok; refuse_live_combo_on_live). Verify
     the wiring: place_core ordering gate → posture → connect (all offline before connect); multiplier
     from contract.security_type via matches!(SecurityType::Option); is_mkt from order.order_type=="MKT";
     every Err → AppError::config; option_combo refuse BEFORE the gate on !cfg.preview. Verify the RED
     LINES held: require_live_write_gate body unchanged; place_with_client untouched (⇒ option-close
     EXEMPT); option_close/cancel/shape_preview JSON/config.rs untouched; fail-closed on bad
     OMI_MAX_NOTIONAL (never defaults to 500). Confirm containment: write code still ONLY in trade.rs.
  2. FULL-SUITE GATE (CC): cargo build · cargo test (all) · cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings.
     All were green at impl (257/257); re-confirm on the review checkout.
  3. OPERATOR LIVE ACCEPTANCE (CC + operator, Tiger :4001 — never asserted in CI): with the gateway up,
     confirm each refuse exits 5 with NO order placed (verifiable with :4001 DOWN too — refuses are
     pre-connect): `omi --live buy AAPL 100 --limit 250` (over $500 cap) ⇒ exit 5; `omi --live buy AAPL 1`
     (MKT, no --limit) ⇒ exit 5; `omi --live option-combo …` ⇒ exit 5 (combo paper-only); a bad
     OMI_MAX_NOTIONAL (e.g. =abc) ⇒ exit 5 (fail-closed). Then the within-cap path:
     `OMI_MAX_NOTIONAL=100000 omi --live buy AAPL 100 --limit 250` passes the guardrail (reaches the gate,
     which needs OMI_ALLOW_LIVE=1); the first trial order (1 share, within cap) actually places. Verify
     `omi --live orders` is empty before+after each refuse (no order leaked).
  4. MERGE: only pipeline-review merges, after explicit human confirmation. On approve: squash/merge
     feat/live-write-guardrail → main, set current.json stage=review then =done post-merge, journal seq=5
     (review→done). The next feature (operator-decided) is the trade log — NOT this card.
Feature gotchas (reviewer traps):
  - The check lives in place_core (NOT place_with_client) PRECISELY so option-close stays EXEMPT —
    verify the close path is unchanged and would NOT be caught. A check in place_with_client would block
    exits (rejected alt, ADR 0030).
  - shape_preview JSON must be byte-identical — order_preview_command tests are the canary (12/12 green).
    compute_notional mirrors shape_preview's `order.limit_price.map(|l| order.total_quantity * l.abs() *
    multiplier)` exactly; preview was NOT routed through compute_notional (kept independent to avoid any
    shape change).
  - Fail-closed is the core safety property: resolve_max_notional on a non-numeric/≤0/non-finite value
    MUST return Err (⇒ AppError::config ⇒ exit 5), never fall back to 500. The "inf"/"nan" cases parse to
    f64 but is_finite() refuses them.
  - The within-cap→place path is NOT freezable (places a real live order) — it is operator live
    acceptance, the trial itself. Do not attempt to assert it in CI.
  - Paper (:4002) and --preview are entirely unaffected (is_live=false ⇒ Ok; preview short-circuits
    before the guardrail).
Done when: semantic review passes (seams + wiring + red lines); full-suite green; operator live
acceptance signed off (refuses exit 5, first trial order places); merged to main; current.json stage=done;
journal seq=5 pushed. On failure: PR comments; attempts++; >=3 ⇒ blocked ⇒ run pipeline-hunt.
