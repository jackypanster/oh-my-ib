# journal — brief-command

## seq=1 · 2026-07-03T02:06:15Z · prd→arch · completed · by=claude-fable-5(claude-code)
done:   New feature: `omi brief` — the daily snapshot (account_summary + pnl + pnl_by_position +
        positions + orders + executions) in ONE gateway connection, one composite JSON. Chosen in a
        /think ROI pass over option-chains (unproven need, entitlement risk) and multi-symbol quote
        (side flow): the daily flow costs 6–7 connects today AND back-to-back reconnects are the
        documented EAGAIN race (src/ib/mod.rs:38-48) — brief removes the class at its cause; all six
        data paths already live-proven on Tiger ⇒ near-zero API risk. Operator locked (HITL): D1
        feature choice; D2 verbatim-nesting shape (account hoisted once, sections = source payloads
        minus wrapper, preview-confirmed); D3 whole-command fail-fast (repo no-partial rule); D4 name
        `brief` (snapshot/summary collide with existing terminology). Code-locked: D5 one connection,
        sequential fetch via *_with_client refactor seams; D6 as_of = gateway server_time. Key risk
        for arch: the full six-dataset one-session interleaving is new as a whole (ADR 0009 proved
        the hardest pair: account_updates drain → N×pnl_single); single account_updates drain should
        feed 3 sections (AccountValue + PortfolioValue in one stream). Decision-complete PRD written;
        current.json repointed to brief-command @ prd.

repo=git@github.com:jackypanster/oh-my-ib.git branch=main pr=none
Model: frontier SOTA required — operator assigns the bot; the pipeline can't verify the model.
First: git pull --rebase; no .env in this repo (config lives at ~/.config/oh-my-ib/config.toml, not needed for arch).
Read for context (before acting):
  - oh-my-ib/AGENTS.md — repo conventions (agent-first authoring, hard safety rules, verify model). Read FIRST.
  - .pipeline/brief-command/PRD.md — what (D1–D6 locked; success criteria 1–10; risks name your verification targets)
  - .pipeline/pnl-by-position/arch.md + docs/adr/* — prior art: ADR 0007 (take-first, markerless streams), ADR 0009 (two-phase sweep on one session)
  - src/ib/mod.rs — connect/retry layer + the EAGAIN comment (the race brief kills)
  - src/ib/{account,pnl,pnl_by_position,positions,orders,executions}.rs — the six fetch paths brief orchestrates
Your task (concrete, numbered):
  1. grill-with-docs the architecture against the codebase: the *_with_client refactor seam for each
     of the six modules (public fn keeps its own connect; brief shares one Client).
  2. Verify in ibapi-3.1.0 SOURCE (not guessed) per-pair session safety of the sequential interleaving:
     account_updates drain → pnl take-first → N×pnl_single take-first → open_orders → executions
     (request-id isolation, subscription cleanup on drop, singleton subscriptions like reqAccountUpdates).
     Decide the fetch order + whether ONE account_updates drain feeds account_summary/positions/
     pnl_by_position-discovery (AccountValue + PortfolioValue in one pass) — PRD Scope expects yes.
  3. Emit arch.md + CONTEXT.md + docs/adr/* (ADR for the one-session interleaving + the shared-drain
     decision; record the fallback deform — internal sequential sessions, distinct client_ids — as
     last resort). Advance current.json.stage=arch, append journal seq=2, commit once, push.
Feature gotchas (project-specific traps the next node MUST know):
  - Fail-fast no-partial is a repo IRON RULE (pnl_by_position.rs header) — no per-section error objects.
  - Section shapes are FROZEN BY REFERENCE to the six source commands (PRD criterion 2 hoisting rule);
    brief adds NO new row shapes — arch must not invent any.
  - orders.rs emits {"open_orders":[...]} with NO account wrapper (unlike the other five) — the
    hoisting rule already accounts for it; don't "fix" it.
  - ADR 0007: pnl/pnl_single streams are markerless — take-first, NEVER drain-to-End; a drain loop
    hangs forever. account_updates DOES have an End marker — drain it.
  - Public repo: no account ids/balances in any committed artifact.
Done when: arch.md + CONTEXT.md + ADRs on trunk, journal seq=2 appended, stage=arch pushed.
On success: run pipeline-task. On failure: attempts++; >=3 ⇒ blocked ⇒ run pipeline-hunt.

done:   Architecture locked, zero human questions needed (every PRD claim verified in ibapi-3.1.0
        source). ADR 0010: one session, strictly sequential consume-then-drop fetch; full routing-
        domain table verified in transport/routing.rs (CommissionsReport routes ByExecutionId —
        cannot be stolen by the orders shared channel; OpenOrderEnd/ExecutionDataEnd → EndOfStream);
        fixed fetch order resolve→as_of→drain→pnl→sweep→orders→executions; fallback deform =
        internal sequential sessions (recorded, NOT implemented). ADR 0011: consolidated
        account_updates drain feeds account_summary+positions+discovery in ONE pass (singleton
        re-subscribe window never opens); shared row builders keep sections byte-identical to
        source commands; as_of = server_time() (UTC by construction, decoders/mod.rs:60-64)
        formatted via inherent accessors — NO new dependency. Pure frozen seam = assemble_brief
        (exact 8-key top level, pass-through). Table rendering needs NO output.rs change (generic
        dotted-prefix renderer, output.rs:44-75). arch.md carries the impl write-set: new
        src/ib/brief.rs + seam extractions in account/positions/pnl/pnl_by_position/orders/

Model: frontier SOTA required — operator assigns the bot; the pipeline can't verify the model.
First: git pull --rebase; no .env in this repo (config at ~/.config/oh-my-ib/config.toml, not needed offline).
Read for context (before acting):
  - oh-my-ib/AGENTS.md — repo conventions. Read FIRST.
  - .pipeline/brief-command/PRD.md — what (criteria 1–10)
  - .pipeline/brief-command/arch.md — components, JSON contract, Freeze coverage (your card content)
  - .pipeline/brief-command/CONTEXT.md + docs/adr/0010,0011 — binding decisions
  - tests/pnl_by_position_command.rs + tests/cli_contract.rs — the frozen-test patterns to mirror
Your task (concrete, numbered):
  1. Decompose into cards. Expectation: ONE card (single subcommand + seam refactors, one frozen
     test file) — split only if you find a real seam (e.g. refactor-siblings card + brief card).
  2. FREEZE COMMIT (touches ONLY spec-paths): write tests/brief_command.rs — black-box CLI
     (omi --help lists brief; omi brief --help exit 0; dead-port omi brief → non-zero +
     {"error":{...}} stderr) + pure seam assemble_brief (exact 8-key top-level set
     {account,as_of,account_summary,pnl,pnl_by_position,positions,orders,executions}; account/as_of
     pass-through; section Values pass through unmodified; no extra keys). Tests MUST compile and
     FAIL now (assemble_brief does not exist yet — use the pnl_by_position_command.rs import style;
     trunk goes red, accepted per CONTRACT §Test ownership). ONE commit for the whole feature ⇒ its
     hash = spec-rev on every card.
  3. RECORD COMMIT (metadata only): tasks/NN.md frontmatter (status=todo, attempts=0, verify =
     CARD-SCOPED runner e.g. `cargo test --test brief_command`, spec-paths=[tests/brief_command.rs],
     impl-paths=[src/ib/brief.rs, src/ib/account.rs, src/ib/positions.rs, src/ib/pnl.rs,

     current.json.stage=task + full-verify=["cargo build","cargo test"]; append journal seq=3;
     commit, push.
Feature gotchas (project-specific traps the next node MUST know):
  - spec-paths ∩ impl-paths = ∅ — the frozen test must NOT touch src/**.
  - assemble_brief is the ONLY new frozen seam; do NOT freeze the gateway fn, the drain, as_of
    formatting, or sibling behavior (Freeze coverage in arch.md is exact).
  - Frozen test constructs plain serde_json::Value sections — ibapi-free (PnlSingleRow precedent).
  - Card verify must be card-scoped (cargo test --test brief_command), NEVER the full suite
    (trunk is red until impl merges — full suite would deadlock the loop).
  - Public repo: no account ids/balances in test fixtures.
Done when: freeze commit + record commit pushed; card 01 todo with correct spec-rev; trunk suite RED
only by tests/brief_command.rs. On success: run pipeline-impl.
On failure: attempts++; >=3 ⇒ blocked ⇒ run pipeline-hunt.

Read for context (before acting):

  - src/ib/pnl_by_position.rs + src/ib/account.rs + src/ib/positions.rs — the modules you extract seams from
Your task (concrete, numbered):
  1. Flip card 01 → in-progress (commit metadata on main, push). Cut feat/brief-command from trunk.
  2. On the branch: implement per the card's Scope — src/ib/brief.rs (assemble_brief pure seam +
     brief(cfg) gateway fn, ADR 0010 fixed fetch order), the six sibling with-client/builder seam
     extractions (behavior byte-identical), mod.rs re-exports, cli.rs Brief variant, main.rs dispatch.
  3. Verify: card-scoped `cargo build` + `cargo test --test brief_command` GREEN; then run the whole
     suite `cargo test` (must be GREEN — trunk red was ONLY tests/brief_command.rs) + `cargo clippy
     --all-targets -- -D warnings`.
  4. Push branch, open PR (gh pr create, base main, title "feat(brief-command): omi brief — ...").
     Flip card 01 → review, journal seq=4 on main, push.
Feature gotchas (project-specific traps the next node MUST know):
  - NEVER touch tests/brief_command.rs or any tests/* (freeze gate = two-commit diff over spec-paths).
  - take-first (next_data) for pnl/pnl_single — a drain loop hangs forever (ADR 0007/0009);
    drain-to-End for account_updates/all_open_orders/executions.
  - ONE account_updates subscription per brief (ADR 0011) — drop it before the pnl request.
  - as_of: name NO time-crate type; inherent accessors + u8::from(t.month()) only (ADR 0011 §3).
  - orders section: filter by cfg.account ONLY when set — do NOT auto-filter to resolved account.
  - The six public command fns must stay byte-identical in behavior — review rejects ANY sibling drift.
  - Public repo: no account ids in code, tests, or PR text.
Done when: verify green + full suite green + clippy clean on the branch; PR open; card 01 status=review;
journal seq=4 pushed. On success: run pipeline-review. On failure: attempts++; >=3 ⇒ blocked ⇒ pipeline-hunt.

     tests/brief_command.rs — non-empty ⇒ REJECT (attempts++, card→todo, route impl). Also check no

  2. FULL-SUITE GATE: on a detached worktree at the PR head run current.json.full-verify exactly:
     cargo build && cargo test (whole suite, unfiltered) + cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings.
  3. SEMANTIC REVIEW (card Freeze coverage names the read-targets): brief(cfg) fetch order matches
     ADR 0010; consolidated drain matches ADR 0011 (ONE account_updates subscription; drop before pnl);
     take-first for pnl/pnl_single vs drain-to-End for account_updates/all_open_orders/executions;

Model: frontier SOTA required — operator assigns the bot; the pipeline can't verify the model.
Required before merge (in order):
  1. Operator restarts the Tiger/IB gateway (live :4001) — the current session's reqPnL channel is
     polluted by orphaned subscriptions from the wedge diagnostics.
  2. One clean re-acceptance from the PR-head worktree (or any checkout of 6808d09):
     `omi --live brief` → exit 0, 8 keys, numeric pnl, NO wedge. Do NOT run standalone
     `omi --live pnl` immediately before it (known wedge trigger on this gateway build).
  3. Operator explicitly authorizes the merge.
On confirm (all three): git pull --rebase; verify PR #10 head still 6808d09 (changed head ⇒ re-run
